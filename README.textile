h2. Building

p. This project uses ant for building, but mostly because I am lazy. I use Eclipse for editing and use ant for deploying and so on. You can build and compile from within Eclipse as the project file is correctly setup, but the ant file creates the plugin zip file and copies it to the TeamCity plugin directory.

bc.. 
# in order to compile and deploy the plugin
ant -Dtc.home=/opt/TeamCity -Dtc.data.dir=/opt/.BuildServer deploy

p. Other targets exists as well, but they are usually not required when editing from within Eclipse.
